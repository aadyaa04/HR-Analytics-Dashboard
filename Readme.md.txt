ðŸ“Š HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Employee Turnover Case Study  

ðŸ”¹ Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze employee turnover data using **SQL** and **Power BI** to identify key drivers of attrition, provide actionable insights, and help HR managers design retention strategies.  

---

ðŸ”¹ Data Source  
- Dataset: HR Employee Turnover (from Kaggle)  
- Rows: ~15,000 employees  
- Columns: Employee satisfaction, evaluation scores, projects, working hours, tenure, promotions, salary, department, attrition flag  

---

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used  
- SQLite â€“ Data cleaning & exploratory SQL queries  
- Power BI â€“ Data modeling, calculated columns, DAX measures, interactive dashboard creation  

---

ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation  
1. Imported raw CSV into SQLite and ran SQL queries to explore attrition patterns.  
2. Loaded cleaned dataset into Power BI.  
3. Created custom calculated columns for better analysis:  
   - **TenureGroup** â†’ Categorized employees by years at company (`<=2`, `3â€“5`, `>5`)  
   - **AttritionLabel** â†’ Converted binary attrition flag (0/1 â†’ Stayed/Left)  
   - **SatisfactionBand** â†’ Classified employees into Low / Medium / High satisfaction  

4. Built DAX measures:  
   - `Total Employees`  
   - `Employees Left`  
   - `Attrition Rate`  
   - `Average Satisfaction`  
   - `Average Monthly Hours`

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights  
1. Departments: Sales, Technical, and Support see the highest attrition.  
2. Salary: Employees with low salaries account for the majority of attrition.  
3. Tenure: Employees with 3â€“5 years at the company are most likely to leave.  
4. Promotion: Employees without promotions in the last 5 years are far more likely to exit.  
5. Satisfaction: Majority of employees who left reported low satisfaction(<0.4).  
6. Work Accident: Accident history has minimal correlation with attrition.

ðŸ”¹ Business Recommendations  
Based on the analysis, HR managers should focus on:  
-Compensation: Reassess salary structure for low-paid employees.  
-Career Growth: Provide promotion and upskilling opportunities, especially for 3â€“5 year tenure employees.  
-Department Focus: Prioritize retention strategies in Sales and Technical teams.  
-Employee Engagement: Regular feedback surveys and recognition programs to boost satisfaction.

-  Delivered actionable insights for strategic HR decision-making.
